## Overview

KismetE-Commerce is a dummy e-commerce web application written in ASP<span></span>.NET Core within a Linux development environment.

It is my way of practising .NET Core development from Linux, utilizing the fundamentals I've learned while developing from within a Windows environment.

This site is **NOT** a real, production e-commerce site. No products are real, no payments will be accepted, nor am I or anyone else liable for any loss of finances, credit, etc if you choose to enter real financial or personal information within this site.
